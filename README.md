# Working on React and Redux 

For theses project:

**_Use [React CDN](https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html) in the index.html_**
- copy the first 2 lines of script on the top of the page
- paste in the <head>head html tag</head>, under <meta> html tag
- the top script is the core react library
- the bottom script is the react DOM library

**_VS code packages_**
- ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets
    - this will give you some snippets of code 
    - can easily create components or imports, etc
