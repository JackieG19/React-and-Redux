**Components**
- core building blocks for making reusable pieces of html 
- contain 'state' (data or UI state)
- contain javascript for functionality
- taking all the components and creates a javascript representation of the DOM called the vitrual DOM
- takes the vitrual DOM and renders it to the browser which creates the actual DOM base on it
